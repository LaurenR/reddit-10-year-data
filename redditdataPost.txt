#Reddit ten year data

*All data in this post is accurate as of June 21st, 2015.*

We pulled a bunch of data together for today's ten-year anniversary blog post, but not all of it made the cut. I wanted to take some time to dump everything here in /r/redditdata. If you build anything cool, shoot me a PM, I'd love to see it!

*[Repo](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data)*

----------

**[Things by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/thingsByMonth.csv)**  
Number of accounts, subreddits, submissions, and comments created each month of reddit's history

**[Running total of things by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/totalThingsByMonth.csv)**  
Just a to-date total of the previous dataset, but it's comforting that the numbers match

**[Most upvoted threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/)**  
Note: this actually excludes posts from subreddits which are excluded from /r/all, but you wouldn't see any in the Top 20 anyway. 

**[Unique users and pageviews by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/Uniques%2BPageviewsByMonth.csv)**

**[US vs Non-US traffic by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/USvsIntlTrafficByMonth.csv)**  
Note: this was not measured prior to Feb 2010, so data before then is a simple linear regression.

**[Upvotes & Downvotes to submissions by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/linkVotesByMonth.csv)**  
The steady climb of the ratio is really interesting. This is only including votes that were counted (i.e. no spambot votes)

**[Upvotes & Downvotes to submissions by month](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/commentVotesByMonth.csv)**  
Again, this is only including votes that were counted (i.e. no spambot votes)

**[Upvotes & Downvotes to comments by month]()**  

**[Top 20 commented threads](https://github.com/drunken-economist/reddit-10-year-data/blob/master/top20CommentedThreads.csv)**

Sorry, we tried. Post saves have been around since reddit's inception, and looking at every user to see if they saved each post was breaking things.

Let me know if you have any questions on it all! Except for questions about the thread in /r/Spiderman, because I don't get it either.
